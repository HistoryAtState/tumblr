These volumes span the globe during the tumultuous early post-WWII years from 1948 through 1951, when the contours of the Cold War were being drawn. Additionally, these volumes provide great insight into the construction of the national security state and how the United States responded to the rapid decolonization spreading through the Third World during this period.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 the Office of the Historian embarked on a multi-year program to digitize the entire _Foreign Relations of the United States_ series and post these for public access at [history.state.gov](https:\/\/history.state.gov\/historicaldocuments\/). This series, the official documentary record of U.S. foreign policy, dates back to 1861 and consists of over 500 volumes and hundreds of thousands of annotated primary sources from the National Archives, presidential libraries, and agency records. \r\n\r\nTo date, the digitization initiative has resulted in the publication of nearly 250 volumes &ndash; or half of the entire back catalog &ndash; of the _Foreign Relations_ series. This remarkable progress reflects the Office of the Historian&rsquo;s close cooperation with the [University of Wisconsin Madison Digital Collections Center](http:\/\/uwdcc.library.wisc.edu\/), which has provided the [scanned images](http:\/\/www.fdlp.gov\/all-newsletters\/community-insights\/1281-preservingdigitization) of these volumes, which the Office [subsequently converted](http:\/\/blogs.state.gov\/stories\/2012\/05\/23\/150-year-old-publication-enters-e-book-age) into high quality text. \r\n\r\nUntil today, we have released newly digitized volumes silently, adding them to the growing [roster of volumes](https:\/\/history.state.gov\/historicaldocuments\/ebooks) on the website. Future releases will move further into the back catalog, and we look forward to announcing their release in future quarters. The full list of volumes released today is below, with links to the online and ebook versions of these volumes.
