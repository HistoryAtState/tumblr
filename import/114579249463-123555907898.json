When he took a break from reviewing defense policy files, Josh asked to take a peek at the document she had encountered as she had processed the records.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the research that Josh had already done in Department of State records, he assumed that the NSC staffers&rsquo; interest had been inspired by efforts undertaken by the Historian&rsquo;s Office in 1984 and 1985 to secure Reagan&rsquo;s endorsement for a major acceleration initiative. Josh was surprised to discover that this was not the case at all. Instead, in April 1987, NSC Legal Adviser Nicholas Rostow had taken a break from reviewing the negotiating record for the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to hail &ldquo;one of the great achievements &hellip; of the United States: the publishing history of \u003Ci\u003EForeign Relations of the United States\u003C\/i\u003E.&rdquo; Although Rostow got many of the details wrong in the subsequent five-paragraph overview of the evolution of the \u003Ci\u003EFRUS\u003C\/i\u003E series (\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/history.state.gov\/historicaldocuments\/frus-history\/chapter-7\u0022\u003Eif only\u003C\/a\u003E &ldquo;Dulles and Eden agreed that there was no serious problem with publishing the Yalta and Potsdam records&rdquo;), he clearly regarded the series as an important manifestation of the government&rsquo;s obligation to inform the public about its diplomacy.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERostow&rsquo;s emailed memorandum elicited a quick rejoinder from NSC Counselor Peter Rodman, who cited the 1949 China \u003Ci\u003EWhite Paper\u003C\/i\u003E and the 1955 Yalta \u003Ci\u003EFRUS\u003C\/i\u003E volume as examples of instances when &ldquo;document release has &hellip; been used as a political weapon.&rdquo; Rodman&rsquo;s rejoinder to Rostow was striking for how vividly he recalled the controversies surrounding the official publication of foreign policy documents in the early years of the Cold War and how directly he applied the lessons of that past to the contemporary challenge of &ldquo;defending ourselves against an assault by self-serving ex-negotiators plus the Soviets who have been quite expansive in disseminating their own versions of the [ABM] negotiating history.&rdquo;\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClick \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/history.state.gov\/historicaldocuments\/frus-history\/\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C\/a\u003E to explore a much more &ldquo;thorough, accurate, and reliable&rdquo; account of the history of the \u003Ci\u003EForeign Relations\u003C\/i\u003E series.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can read the 1987 exchange between Rostow and Rodman here:\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cfigure data-orig-height=\u00222700\u0022 data-orig-width=\u00222516\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https:\/\/40.media.tumblr.com\/b033e7d40b7eeb927cc2d7634e521b17\/tumblr_inline_nlvumv1ALz1ryrtsk_500.jpg\u0022 data-orig-height=\u00222700\u0022 data-orig-width=\u00222516\u0022\u003E\u003C\/figure\u003E\u003Cfigure data-orig-height=\u00221962\u0022 data-orig-width=\u00222533\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https:\/\/36.media.tumblr.com\/eb8e9a981769e40b0dfc1196d7dbcd14\/tumblr_inline_nlvun2LBfh1ryrtsk_500.jpg\u0022 data-orig-height=\u00221962\u0022 data-orig-width=\u00222533\u0022\u003E\u003C\/figure\u003E\u003Cfigure data-orig-height=\u00221859\u0022 data-orig-width=\u00222513\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https:\/\/40.media.tumblr.com\/9e817cbab3302e9ccfc882ed8b3bbaf4\/tumblr_inline_nlvun80dH71ryrtsk_500.jpg\u0022 data-orig-height=\u00221859\u0022 data-orig-width=\u00222513\u0022\u003E\u003C\/figure\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003ECitation: Nicholas Rostow to Alison Fortier, Robert Linhard, Peter Rodman, Steven Steiner, Paul Schott Stevens, and William Tobey, April 29, 1987 and Rodman email to Rostow (copied to Stevens, Linhard, and Fortier), April 30, 1987 in Reagan Library, Nicholas Rostow Files, Box 15, Unclassified Chron File April 1987.\u003C\/i\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E","is_current_item":true,"is_root_item":true}]},{"blog_name":"historyatstate","id":114579249463,"post_url":"http:\/\/historyatstate.tumblr.com\/post\/114579249463\/the-travels-of-secretary-john-foster-dulles","slug":"the-travels-of-secretary-john-foster-dulles","type":"text","date":"2015-03-25 13:34:46 GMT","timestamp":1427290486,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"CqOphKSF","tags":["John Foster Dulles","Department of State","history","diplomatic history","palladio","foreign policy","Southeast Asia","visualization","VSFS","Indochina"],"short_url":"http:\/\/tmblr.co\/ZXit0u1gjT9at","recommended_source":null,"highlighted":[],"note_count":3,"title":"The Travels of Secretary John Foster Dulles","body":"\u003Cp\u003EIn his six years of service, Secretary of State \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/history.state.gov\/departmenthistory\/people\/dulles-john-foster\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EJohn Foster Dulles\u003C\/a\u003E made over 120 \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/history.state.gov\/departmenthistory\/travels\/secretary\/dulles-john-foster\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ediplomatic trips\u003C\/a\u003E abroad and visited 46 countries.
