U.S. Ambassador to Germany Frederic Mosley Sackett (1930\u201333) argued that Br\u00fcning\u2019s fall \u201crepresents a definite challenge on the part of land owning class and the big industrialists to the power of the German trade unions.\u201d (June 8, 1932;\u00a0\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/digicoll.library.wisc.edu\/cgi-bin\/FRUS\/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1932v02&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=301\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EBerlin 1777\u003C\/a\u003E) \u00a0In order to prevent the Reichstag from dismissing von Papen, Hindenburg dissolved Parliament and called for new elections, set for July 31&#160;1932.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShortly before the elections, von Papen repealed Br\u00fcning\u2019s ban on the Nazi Storm Troopers, who had terrorized the Nazi\u2019s political opponents.

The focus of this volume is the Carter administration\u2019s efforts to help negotiate settlements to the Arab-Israeli dispute. The volume begins in January 1977, and documents the administration\u2019s immediate efforts to find a comprehensive settlement between Israel and Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon, and to seek a resolution for Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza.\u00a0 The first part of the volume documents the administration\u2019s initiatives to reconvene the Geneva Conference, which was first established in December 1973 to find a comprehensive settlement to the Arab-Israeli dispute.\u00a0 After talks with the various parties stagnated and Sadat made his momentous visit to Jerusalem in November 1977, the administration came to view a bilateral negotiation between Egypt and Israel as the most realistic avenue to an eventual settlement.\u00a0 Accordingly, the portion of the volume covering the period from December 1977 to August 1978 documents the ways in which the administration worked to find a path to a bilateral peace agreement that would also include limited self-rule for Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza. The volume concludes with the White House announcement of a summit to be held at Camp David, Maryland in September 1978, where U.S. officials would work in seclusion with Egyptian and Israeli officials in an attempt to produce an agreement.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis volume was compiled and edited by Adam M.

Nixon and Gerald R. Ford presidential administrations. Because of the long-term nature of the SALT II negotiations, however, this volume also includes the period of the Jimmy Carter administration, as Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter worked to resolve the complex, evolving, and interrelated issues necessary to reach an agreement. All three presidents sought to go beyond the Interim Agreement signed at the Moscow Summit in May 1972 through the achievement of a formal treaty on strategic arms. The negotiations were a central component of foreign policy for all three administrations, demanding sustained attention at the highest level of government. This volume offers a rare direct comparison of bureaucratic processes and leadership styles as well as the personal and institutional interplay across these administrations.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis volume was compiled and edited by Erin R.
