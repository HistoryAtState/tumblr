By contrast, the portion of the population \u201cwho really understand the nature of the question at issue and who advocate the cause of the United States as identical with the progress of free institutions all over the world is comparatively insignificant.\u201d Only this last group, Adams noted, saw the war as a \u201cnecessity\u201d; all others \u201cconsider it as more or less the offspring of mere passion.\u201d Perhaps the Lincoln administration feared the effect on Union morale of suggesting that a large portion of the British population would have been satisfied with Confederate independence. Whatever the reason for its exclusion, the editors deleted Adams\u2019s long discussion of British opinion, along with his statement that Seward\u2019s strong reaction to any \u201cproclivity to a recognition\u201d produced the desired effect. Only the conclusion that Adams was \u201cearnestly assured\u201d that the \u201csympathy with the government of the United States is general\u201d made it to publication, preserving the appearance of support at the expense of conveying a more complex political situation.\u003C\/p\u003E"},{"blog_name":"historyatstate","id":72762697295,"post_url":"http:\/\/historyatstate.tumblr.com\/post\/72762697295\/usnatarchives-our-symposium-a-city-divided","slug":"usnatarchives-our-symposium-a-city-divided","type":"photo","date":"2014-01-09 13:07:41 GMT","timestamp":1389272861,"state":"published","format":"html","reblog_key":"ojimwnjK","tags":[],"short_url":"http:\/\/tmblr.co\/ZXit0u13m-gPF","highlighted":[],"note_count":31,"caption":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca class=\u0022tumblr_blog\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/usnatarchives.tumblr.com\/post\/72762420657\/our-symposium-a-city-divided-life-and-death-in\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Eusnatarchives\u003C\/a\u003E:\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOur symposium\u00a0 \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022Apple-converted-space\u0022\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u201cA City Divided: Life and Death in the Shadow of the Wall\u201d is next Tuesday, on January 14, from 9 a.m. to noon.

Jefferson examined carefully English Parliamentary practices from the 1730s and 1740s, focusing on cases where Members of Parliament demanded information from the King\u2019s ministers about the formulation and implementation of foreign policy, how money was spent, and even data concerning British clandestine intelligence-gathering activities abroad. Jefferson concluded that the Chief Executive was indeed obligated to share as much information as possible with the peoples\u2019 representatives who held the purse strings, although some exceptions could be made for particularly sensitive material. Jefferson, the champion of steering a course independent of the United Kingdom, nevertheless relied upon English legal and parliamentary precedent to strike a functional balance concerning the exercise of power between the branches of government that continues to shape the operation of the U.S. government today.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECurious to learn More?
